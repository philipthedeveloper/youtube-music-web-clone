        Yeah, growin' up, yeah
        Know a lot, but I don't know enough
        What you doin' here?

        Showin' up for tryna show me love
        Why you look 'fused like you don't really know what's up? Yeah

        Why you tryna, tryna front? Yeah
        I am not the man I was, look
        Ayy, made me a promise, I just hope you keep it
        I don't like to get involved with things I don't believe in
        I don't like to hang with people I don't trust to speak with
        If you tell me that you mean it, then I hope you mean it
        Yeah, feel like I don't deserve you when I hurt your feelings
        I'm vulnerable, you got the keys to open all my secrets
        You've always been there when I'm low to help pick up the pieces
        I know I act like I don't need you yet, but lately, I've been thinking
        Yeah, lately, I've been thinking
        Yeah, yeah, I have been thinking
        Yeah, I have been thinking
        Yeah, I wish that I was optimistic
        I wish that I could trust my intuition
        To most, negative thinking makes you a pessimist, but
        To me, negative thinking means I'm just realistic
        That's how I feel, ain't that a twisted view?
        Claim that I don't care what people think, but is that really true?
        Those the type of questions that I struggle with
        That's the type of thing to keep me up at night
        Wondering, I wonder if the pressure I've been under is too much on my shoulders
        Who gon' care when this all fades, I turn grey and get older?
        Yeah, that's the type of thing that I don't wanna answer
        But just 'cause I don't wanna do it don't mean I don't have to
        See, these are lessons that you learn in life
        And we only get one of 'em, hope I'm learning right
        I know that everything comes with a price
        Yeah, yeah, everything comes with a price
        Y'all got no clue what I have sacrificed and lately, I've been thinking
        Yeah, lately, I've been thinking
        Yeah, yeah, I have been thinking
        Yeah, I have been thinking (I have been thinking)`,

        Even if we both break down tonight
        And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
        I know everything will be alright
        I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
        I just need
        A little time to show you I'm worth it
        I know that I can be a difficult person
        I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
        Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
        Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
        Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
        Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
        I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
        And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
        That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
        Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
        I'm the definition of "wreck" if you look into my soul
        Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
        Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
        When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
        But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if
        Even if we both break down tonight
        And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
        I know everything will be alright
        I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing

        I just need time (oh)
        I, I need time (oh)
        Time (oh), time (oh)
        Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
        We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
        Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
        Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
        You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
        Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
        Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
        Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
        Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
        Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
        Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
        When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
        And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
        Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
        Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
        That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if-
        Even if we both break down tonight
        And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
        I know everything will be alright
        I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
        I just need
        Time (oh)
        I, I need time (oh, oh)
        I just need time (oh)

        Give me peace, but then you steal it
        Watch them laugh at all my secrets
        Scream and yell, but I feel speechless
        Ask for help, you call it weakness

        Let You Down goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (ay)
        Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
        I push away the people that I love the most, why? (woo)
        I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable, why? (woo)
        That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable, why? (ay)
        Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
        Until I die, this isn't Nate's flow (woo)
        Just let me rhyme, I'm in disguise
        I'm a busy person, got no time for lies, one of a kind
        They don't see it, I pull out they eyes, I'm on the rise!
        I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (woo)
        Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
        As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
        Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo!
        They don't invite me to the parties but I still arrive
        Kick down the door and then I go inside
        Give off that "I do not belong here" vibe
        Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
        Why do y'all look mortified? (ay)
        I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
        Let You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (woo)
        Story time, wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah)
        If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
        I, I don't care what anybody else thinks, lies (haha)
        I do not need nobody to help me, lies
        I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy, why?
        I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like, "Why?
        Just tell me why, not back to this flow
        Inside I feel divided
        Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
        Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, "Who am I, man?" Woo!
        Nothin' to me's ever good enough
        I could be workin' for twenty-four hours a day and think I never did enough
        My life is a movie but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (no)
        I wanna be great but I get it in the way of myself
        And I think about everything that I could never be
        Why do I do it though? Ay, yeah
        Why you always lookin' aggravated?
        Not a choice, you know I had to make it
        When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
        Like somethin' then I gotta take it
        Write somethin' then I might erase it
        I love it, then I really hate it
        What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know
        I know I like to preach to always be yourself (yeah)
        But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
        Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
        Which feels like I'm at war inside myself but I forgot the shells
        I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
        A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
        Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
        A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well
        Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces`,
